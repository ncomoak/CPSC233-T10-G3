Our game is going to be a top-down, randomly generated Rouge-like maze. The mazes will be either procedurally generated or hand made with
each level becoming progressively harder to solve. The game will randomly generate monsters that the player will fight, and will include 
a shop system in which players can purchase weapons and armour. In order to do so, the players can earn coins and experience by defeating
monsters. The graphics will resemble that of a classic arcade game. 
	The player will have the option of choosing their class and race which comes with their respective skills,
  abilities and strengths. These races include elf, dwarf and goblin, while classes include rouge, mage and archer.
  Additionally, the player will also have health, defence and experience stats.  If the player dies or if the time runs out before
  the player exit the maze, the current level will restart. If the player exists in the maze, a new maze will be randomly generated.
